I work with Windows Server, Active Directory, and network systems, building scripts and tools to automate tasks, monitor uptime, and streamline workflows. I enjoy turning manual processes into code, optimizing system performance, and creating utilities that make administration faster and more reliable.

**Languages:** C, C++, Python, PowerShell, Bash

Rust & ASM Sometimes

**Interests:**  
- Automation & system optimization  
- Networking & infrastructure  
- Cybersecurity & security hardening  
- Monitoring & troubleshooting

ðŸ”§ Occasionally share scripts and tools I build along the way.
